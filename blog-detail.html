        <p style="line-height:1.8em;">I have background in technical field and worked in my home country. After I came to Us I had a pause in my career, started college and got license of teacher very soon As I am mom of two little kids I had to take care of them and at the same time socialize  in a new environment  .I stayed there for two years intill my daughter was 5, then she went to school and it was time of transitioning back to my profession and recently I took a technical training to update my skills. This training will benefit any company  because I will be able to fix computer hardware, software and user program issues and be able to troubleshoot.I have strong computer skills and am good team worker.  I worked with any age of person starting from students at the University of Georgia  ,  school age children, kindergarthen age kids and finishing with colleagues. </p>

        <p style="line-height:1.7em;">As a goal, I would like to work with a team that focuses on clear communication and teamwork. As a result of using my problem-solving skills to add value to my clients, I see significant benefits for myself as well as the company. For me to be able to create positive change, I can align myself with a company that I believe in. Whenever I have the opportunity to learn more, I am eager to do so and am willing to take on challenging projects. My goal is to always strive for excellence.
